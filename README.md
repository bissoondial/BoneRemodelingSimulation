# BoneRemodelingSimulation
Netlogo simulation showcasing the bone remodeling process in the short term.
This project was completed as part of the bioinformatics class 'Simulation in Biology'. The bone remodeling process was simulated and analyzed statistically to indicate trends of biological significance.
Information about each agent used in the simulation can be found in the pdf file 'Bone Remodeling Handout', and results of ANOVA analysis can be found in the pdf file 'Bone Remodeling Analysis'.
